# Breaking the Data Transfer Bottleneck

### Key Features

**Fast**. UDT is designed for extremely high speed networks and it has been used to support global data transfer of terabyte sized data sets. UDT is the core technology in many commercial WAN acceleration products.

**Fair and Friendly**. Concurrent UDT flows can share the available bandwidth fairly, while UDT also leaves enough bandwidth for TCP.

**Easy to Use**. UDT resides completely at the application level. Users can simply download the software and start to use it. No kernel reconfiguration is needed. In addition, UDT's API is very similar to the traditional socket API so that existing applications can be easily modified.

**Highly Configurable**. UDT supports user defined congestion control algorithms with a simple configuration. Users may also modify UDT to suit various situations. This feature can also be used by students and researchers to investigate new control algorithms.

**Firewall Friendly**. UDT is completely based on UDP, which makes it easier to traverse the firewall. In addition, multiple UDT flows can share a single UDP port, thus a firewall can open only one UDP port for all UDT connections. UDT also supports rendezvous connection setup.
